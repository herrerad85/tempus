/**
 * Rebuilds the download table from the ExoPlayer download index.
 *
 * A version bump shipped without a matching migration, so upgrading from 4.22.x dropped every table
 * in tempo_db. The audio and the ExoPlayer index that tracks it are a separate store and survived,
 * leaving files on disk and an empty Download page. The index is keyed by the same song id the
 * download table uses, so any id present there and missing here is fetched from the server again.
 *
 * Recorded as done when the server answered for every song it was asked about and at least one row
 * came back. A pass that restores nothing is tried again on a later launch, up to MAX_ATTEMPTS,
 * because the likeliest cause is being pointed at the wrong server rather than a library that truly
 * lost every track the device still holds. After that it stops, so a user it can never help does not
 * pay for the scan forever.
 *
 * Two gaps. Song ids are unique only within one server, so downloads from two servers with small
 * integer ids can put one server's title on a row that plays the other's file. And restored rows
 * carry no playlist, because nothing on the device records which playlist a download came from.
